# BFGS-PSO

This is the source code of the PSO-based algorithms associated with our IEEE GRSL paper:

W. Xiong and H. C. So, "Outlier-Robust Passive Elliptic Target Localization," in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, doi: 10.1109/LGRS.2023.3270929.

You could take the code as an explanation for reproducing the corresponding algorithms, as long as the paper above is included as a reference in your manuscript.
You may need to make necessary modifications or tailorings to adapt the code to your specific use case.
